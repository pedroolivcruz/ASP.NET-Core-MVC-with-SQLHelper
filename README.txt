This project was created in ASP.NET Core MVC and can be connected to SQL Server or work using data stored in a JSON repository for demonstration purposes.

The default mode is configured to work with data saved in JSON files, but it is worth remembering that the entire structure and model for accessing SQL Server using Sql.Client and SQLHelper is already inside the project.

To access pages that require login use 135799 as password.
